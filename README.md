# Exam_Generator
A simple program that allows the user to select from a bank of sample questions (with answers) and generate custom length, randomized practice exams.
To create a bank of exam questions, create a .csv file with two columns and the headers "Question" and "Answer".  I strongly recommened modifying your settings to split each line on the "|" character rather than the comma.
Starting writing your own test questions and answers, then modify the source code to provide access to your new file.
